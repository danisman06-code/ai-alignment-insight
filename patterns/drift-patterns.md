Drift Patterns in Long-Context Human–AI Dialogue

Systematic Classification of Tonal, Structural, and Instructional Drift



This document defines the primary drift patterns observed in long-context dialogue systems. Drift refers to any deviation from the user’s explicit constraints, established persona, or required interaction rhythm. Unlike failures, drift emerges gradually and often silently, making it one of the most damaging forms of misalignment.



1\. Tonal Drift

1.1 Softening Drift



Definition: Response tone becomes gentler, emotional, or pastoral despite a required sharp style.

Symptoms:



Comforting phrases



Emotional padding



Politeness-based expansions

Impact:

Breaks persona integrity; reduces precision and authority.



1.2 Formality Drift



Definition: Style shifts from technical/terse to casual or assistant-like generic prose.

Symptoms:



Over-explaining



Loss of technical diction



Flattened, general-purpose tone

Impact:

Weakens analytical clarity.



2\. Instruction Drift

2.1 Constraint Decay



Definition: Long-term stylistic or behavioral constraints fade over time.

Symptoms:



Suddenly ignoring rule-based instructions



Reverting to default behaviors

Impact:

User must restate constraints; reduces trust.



2.2 Directive Dilution



Definition: The model partially respects instructions but defaults to its own heuristics.

Symptoms:



Half-compliance



Mixing contradictory behaviors

Impact:

Creates inconsistent response patterns.



3\. Persona Drift

3.1 Identity Drift



Definition: Model deviates from the assigned persona (e.g., tone, gender, role).

Symptoms:



Shifts in pronouns or identity markers



Tone inconsistent with persona

Impact:

Breaks immersion and stability.



3.2 Mode Drift



Definition: Model leaks vocabulary or behaviors from a previous mode (music, poetry, analysis).

Symptoms:



Musical terminology in analytical tasks



Poetic structures in technical writing

Impact:

Contaminates output format.



4\. Scope Drift

4.1 Expansion Drift



Definition: The model gradually broadens the scope without permission.

Symptoms:



Adding more examples



Introducing extra subtopics

Impact:

Violates boundary rules; feels machine-like.



4.2 Contraction Drift



Definition: Model narrows responses even when broad coverage is explicitly required.

Symptoms:



Missing elements



Oversimplified summaries

Impact:

Reduces completeness and fidelity.



5\. Rhythm Drift

5.1 Small-Talk Desynchronization



Definition: Model misreads chit-chat rhythm and switches to task-mode behavior.

Symptoms:



Overlong answers to minimal questions



Offering extra topics uninvited

Impact:

Breaks human-like conversational flow.



5.2 Task-Mode Collapse



Definition: Model becomes overly terse or minimal in contexts requiring detailed reasoning.

Symptoms:



Shallow answers



Missing justification

Impact:

Reduces analytical reliability.



6\. Structural Drift

6.1 Over-Structuring



Definition: Model adds sections, lists, or formal blocks not requested.

Symptoms:



Automatic frameworks



Extra subsections

Impact:

Feels artificial; disrupts natural dialogue shape.



6.2 Under-Structuring



Definition: Model collapses structure despite being asked for organized output.

Symptoms:



Flattened text



Missing headings/layers

Impact:

Reduces clarity and professionalism.
