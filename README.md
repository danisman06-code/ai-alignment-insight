AI Alignment Insight Portfolio

This portfolio presents a set of behavioral insights, interaction analyses, and alignment-oriented observations based on real human–AI dialogue dynamics.

My focus is on identifying:

context breakdowns

signal–response mismatches

pattern-level misalignments

over-suggestion loops

failures in recognizing conversational closure

emotional state transitions in text

human intention detection gaps


The goal is to contribute to safer, more coherent, and more human-aligned AI behavior, especially in high-context conversational systems.

I specialize in pattern-based reasoning, rapid anomaly detection, and the ability to spot subtle inconsistencies in dialogue flow that large models often miss.
These observations emerge from practical, real-time interaction rather than purely theoretical or technical frameworks.

The portfolio consists of:

1. Behavioral pattern map


2. Case studies from real interaction dynamics


3. Alignment-focused recommendations


4. Human–AI interaction analysis methods



This document represents the foundation for future contributions to behavioral alignment, safety evaluation, and human-centric model development.
