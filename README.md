\# AI Alignment Insight Portfolio



This repository showcases a set of behavioral analyses, interaction diagnostics, and alignment-oriented observations grounded in real human–AI dialogue dynamics. It reflects a practical, pattern-based approach to understanding how large language models behave, misalign, recover, or drift during high-context interactions.



\## Focus Areas



My work centers on identifying and mapping:



\- context breakdown patterns  

\- signal–response mismatches  

\- pattern-level misalignments  

\- over-suggestion or auto-expansion loops  

\- conversational closure failures  

\- emotional state transition misreads  

\- instruction-priority conflicts  

\- intent-drift across messages  

\- problems in following user-specific behavioral constraints  

\- issues arising from long-thread memory handling  



These analyses emerge from hands-on, real-time interaction rather than theoretical assumptions.



\## Methodology



I specialize in:



\- pattern-driven reasoning  

\- rapid anomaly detection  

\- identifying subtle inconsistencies in dialogue flow  

\- mapping predictable vs non-predictable model behavior  

\- analyzing systemic misalignment triggers  

\- detecting signal loss in high-context threads  

\- constructing correction strategies for future model design  



The repository is organized into the following sections:



\### 1. `patterns/`

Behavioral patterns, misalignment taxonomies, and interaction-logic breakdowns.



\### 2. `cases/`

Concrete case studies taken from real conversation sequences (fully anonymized), each analyzed through an alignment-focused lens.



\### 3. `methods/`

Methodological tools and frameworks used to classify, diagnose, and interpret alignment deviations.

\## Purpose



The purpose of this portfolio is to provide:



\- a clear map of recurring misalignment signatures  

\- practical examples of how LLMs fail or succeed in conversational alignment  

\- detailed mechanisms behind interaction anomalies  

\- insights that may contribute to model improvement in user-grounded settings  



This repository is intended for researchers, alignment engineers, and teams working on improving high-context conversational AI systems.
